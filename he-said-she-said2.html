	                	<h2>8.</h2>
	                	<p>It comes in waves, battering the heart</br>
						Bound in metal, sinking to the bottom of a bog.</br>
						Preserved for years while slowly decaying</br>
						Wrapped in cloth and toil.</br>
						Giving into the contemplation</br>
						Confer with the moon</br>
						Confer with the guides to ask for the help of saints and sinners alike.</br>
						They will bring you home in a wooden boat.</p>

						<p>Fallen</br>
						As the tide recedes into the depths of the mind</br>
						It will overwhelm you.</br>
						Scarves tighten at the neck with every breath</br>
						Drawing slowly, lumbering just a bit until the waves pass over,</br>
						Shining through the aquatic greens as angelfish waiting to be eaten</br>
						Swim slowly overhead, floating away until-</p>

						<p>Thump thump thump thump</br>
						Hollow knocking at your door is coming from the hands of volatile strangers</br>
						Disguised as hollow men.</p>

						<p>Metal hearts, they do not shatter.</br>
						They merely withstand abuse, bending at the curves of the ventricles,</br>
						Hanging from the vena cava,</br>
						Knowing it is breaking-</br>
						Knowing it is broken-</br>
						Weathering a punishment it does not deserve.</p>

						<p>Hey now.</br>
						Rusting over time, shortened beats</br>
						Hands folded over hands until the end of time.</br>
						It’s frightening.</p>

						<p>Hanging on the thread that is about to break.</br>
						Choosing,</br>
						Until there is only a single path to walk; hopefully it doesn’t let you down.</br>
						We will forever be a little lost.</br>
						Slow autumns will come by your door,</br>
						Scraping its dying branches across your window, reminding you</br>
						Of lonesome winters.</br>
						Summers pass, tripping on a light fantastic,</br>
						There will be fire springing softly on the brim of your cup, burning the lips</br>
						With a dire bitterness.</p>
