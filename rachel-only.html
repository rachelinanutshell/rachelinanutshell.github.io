	                	<p>It comes in waves, battering the heart</br>
						Bound in metal, sinking to the bottom of a bog.</br>
						Preserved for years while slowly decaying</br>
						Wrapped in cloth and toil.</br>
						Giving into the contemplation</br>
						Confer with the moon</br>
						Confer with the guides to ask for the help of saints and sinners alike.</br>
						They will bring you home in a wooden boat.</p>

						<p>Fallen</br>
						As the tide recedes into the depths of the mind</br>
						It will overwhelm you.</br>
						Scarves tighten at the neck with every breath</br>
						Drawing slowly, lumbering just a bit until the waves pass over,</br>
						Shining through the aquatic greens as angelfish waiting to be eaten</br>
						Swim slowly overhead, floating away until-</p>

						<p>Thump thump thump thump</br>
						Hollow knocking at your door is coming from the hands of volatile strangers</br>
						Disguised as hollow men.</p>

						<p>Metal hearts, they do not shatter.</br>
						They merely withstand abuse, bending at the curves of the ventricles,</br>
						Hanging from the vena cava,</br>
						Knowing it is breaking-</br>
						Knowing it is broken-</br>
						Weathering a punishment it does not deserve.</p>

						<p>Hey now.</br>
						Rusting over time, shortened beats</br>
						Hands folded over hands until the end of time.</br>
						It’s frightening.</p>

						<p>Hanging on the thread that is about to break.</br>
						Choosing,</br>
						Until there is only a single path to walk; hopefully it doesn’t let you down.</br>
						We will forever be a little lost.</br>
						Slow autumns will come by your door,</br>
						Scraping its dying branches across your window, reminding you</br>
						Of lonesome winters.</br>
						Summers pass, tripping on a light fantastic,</br>
						There will be fire springing softly on the brim of your cup, burning the lips</br>
						With a dire bitterness.</p>

	           	 		<h2>Untitled But Long Title</h2>
	           	 		<p>I.</p>
						<p>And she will wait.</br>
						Just to hear him say,</br>
						But your time is over now.</br>
						I’ve found someone new.</br>
						Someone who is someone,</br>
						No ifs, ands, or buts.</br>
						She does not hang on the uncertainty</br>
						Of herself</br>
						As you hang on yourself</br>
						And I hang on myself.</br>
						Why should we condemn each other</br>
						To bewilderment</br>
						When we can chase after the free?</br>
						Why should we look in each other’s eyes,</br>
						And see our confusion mirrored,</br>
						Our circular dances,</br>
						Our inconstant eyes reflecting</br>
						Crossed stars and silent fires?</br>
						Let’s be like the cool kids,</br>
						The confident, self-affirmed army,</br>
						Encased in sureness, steadiness, personality.</br>
						Let us free ourselves</br>
						By losing ourselves</br>
						In the wide eyes of a freer stranger,</br>
						A fascination we cannot be.</br>
						You had your chance once, love.</br>
						You were love once, love.</br>
						But now it’s time to set us free.</br>
						Forward marks the chase,</br>
						So let us go.</p>

						<p>II.</p>
						<p>But she has waited</br>
						Because the future</br>
						And the past are one,</br>
						Coming together</br>
						In this moment –</br>
						The present.</br>
						Let us look in the mirror of each other</br>
						And in him find herself</br>
						And in her find himself</br>
						And understand that neither is the cause</br>
						Of the other, but nonetheless,</br>
						A reason to the other.</br>
						Let us dance that circular dance,</br>
						And communicate like bees,</br>
						To find fresher flowers</br>
						And bear finer fruit.</br>
						Let those crossed stars in our eyes twinkle,</br>
						Make more light for the universe.</br>
						Let us waiver and wander</br>
						And not understand</br>
						And try to understand</br>
						And struggle to understand</br>
						And be free to do so.</br>
						Let us chase our tails until we know</br>
						That truly it belongs to us.</br>
						What dogs would we be without them?</br>
						To think, that I would have neglected thee –</br>
						Oh, tail!</br>
						Let us marvel at the ordinary</br>
						Because we don’t know what to think.</br>
						Oh, come, let us go!</p>

						<p>III.</p>
						<p>And so goes the story,</br>
						The one that will never end,</br>
						But now must.</br>
						There are more lines to be writ,</br>
						But who knows if they will be.</p>
